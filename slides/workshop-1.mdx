Testing Laravel

Why should you test your code?

<Notes>
  * What benefits are there?
  <br />
  <br />* Is it really worth it?
</Notes>

<Header>Why should you test your code?</Header>

Testing gives you confidence

<Notes>
  * They assure that making a change won't break the stuff that previously
  worked.
  <br />
  <br />
  * If the change does break something, the test will catch it long before you do.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Humans are prone to errors and you can't expect to catch all the bugs
  manually.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Having tests makes adding new features, fixing bugs and refactoring much easier.
  <br />
  <br />* Tests are not some hip new thing, they have been around for quite a while
  and they are an essential part of the software development process.
  <br />
  <br />* Contributing to open source projects.

Testing makes you a better developer

<Notes>
  * Writing tests forces you to slow down and think more about the code and
  about the possible edge cases.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Having extremely complex tests is usually an indicator that the code being tested
  can be improved.
  <br />
  <br />
  * You must have heard someone talking about refactoring some code to make it
  "more testable".
  <br />

Testing (actually) saves you time

<Notes>
  * Most common excuses for not testing.
  <br />
  <br />
  ** An example of manual regression testing when the project is already a couple
  of months into development.
</Notes>

Tests are additional documentation

<Notes>
  * A new developer coming into the codebase can learn a lot about some feature
  by looking at its tests.

Types of tests

Unit tests

<Notes>
  * With unit tests, you test a small piece of code (a unit) "in isolation",
  ignoring other parts of the system and only testing that this small unit does
  its (simple) job perfectly.
  <br />
  <br />
  ** Draw a representation of a unit test on the board.
</Notes>

Integration tests

<Notes>
  * With integration tests, you test that several of these "units of code" work
  together in harmony.
  <br />
  <br />
  * Also called "Feature tests".
  <br />
  <br />
  ** Draw a representation of an integration test on the board.

End to End tests

<Notes>
  * Act as a robot that simulates what a user would do in a particular flow of
  the application (clicking on buttons, typing in inputs etc.) from start to
  finish.
  <br />
  <br />* Possible in Laravel with Laravel Dusk, but since we mostly use Laravel
  for developing RESTful JSON APIs, we won't cover that in these workshops.
  <br />
  <br />* There are tools like Cypress for End to End testing of JavaScript
  applications.
